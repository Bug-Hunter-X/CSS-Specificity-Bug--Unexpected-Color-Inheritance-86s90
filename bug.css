The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override the others */
}

/* However, due to specificity, only the selector with highest specificity will apply */
div > p {
  color: purple; /* This rule has higher specificity and overrides the previous */
}
```

The issue arises from the specificity of CSS selectors.  The `div p` selector is less specific than the `div > p` selector. The `>` (child combinator) increases the specificity, making `div > p` win. This might lead to unexpected results if the developer expects `div p` to override `div`'s color.
