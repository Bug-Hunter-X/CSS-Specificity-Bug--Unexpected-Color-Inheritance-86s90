The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and adjusting selectors to achieve the desired outcome:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

/* To override the div's color effectively, make sure the div p selector is more specific or that rules cascade properly */
div p {
  color: green; /* Now this will override the div rule if there are no more specific rules */
}

/* Alternatively, use the important flag but this is not recommended due to potential side effects */
div > p {
  color: purple !important; /*This will force the rule, but it is not ideal for maintainability */
}
```

By adjusting selector specificity or using the `!important` flag (though generally discouraged for maintainability), the desired color can be achieved.  However, it is often preferred to restructure the CSS selectors rather than relying on `!important`.
